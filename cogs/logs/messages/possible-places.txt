(2021-02-25 15:53:08) [possible-places] coleemac: Those are both nice
(2021-02-25 16:03:25) [possible-places] Hojobo: first one might not have laundry
(2021-02-25 16:03:31) [possible-places] Hojobo: we're trying to figure that out
(2021-02-25 16:04:05) [possible-places] Androo: Hmm alright. I agree though. They both are honestly quite nice.
(2021-02-25 16:05:09) [possible-places] Hojobo: it probably has hookups though, and seeing how it's a bit cheaper rentwise, we could just buy a cheapish washer dryer set
(2021-02-25 16:05:43) [possible-places] Hojobo: aaron's also been looking into some other apartments tho, so these arent our only two options anyways

(2021-03-14 19:03:34) [possible-places] Floy: it also has a $205/month HOA fee
(2021-03-14 19:06:28) [possible-places] Androo: Yeah if it has ac even with the fee that would be a good pick
(2021-03-18 09:56:27) [possible-places] coleemac: Our good house got sold

(2021-05-23 13:11:16) [possible-places] Androo: So we posted a different Willow Ridge one before but there's a new one that has been posted that is available June 12th. Figured I'd throw it in since it looks nice and has air (on their site ac is a thing) and laundry and is really close to campus: https://www.trulia.com/p/mi/ypsilanti/2130-arbor-cir-w-203-ypsilanti-mi-48197--2416438063?share_from=copylink
(2021-05-23 13:16:10) [possible-places] Floy: lol oh yea I remember this one
it would probs be a nightmare since our move-out day for this complex would be the next day and Joe and Nicole would be out of town
(2021-05-23 13:18:21) [possible-places] Androo: I mean it's up to you guys but I'm willing to help however if we get a good place

Andrew (not you <@!78648083449122816>) can also split the $50 waitlist deposit among all of us, which would be a total of $87.50 per applicant ($75 per application + $12.50 for a 1/4 of the $50 deposit). 

also when it asks about being referred and such list Jennie Abbott please and thanks!!
