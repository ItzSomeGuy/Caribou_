Just wanted to explain how this spade below works. 
Basically, if you join the spade channel, you will be sent to your own private hole! No one can see it and (by proxy) no one can join in unless you drag them in.
This channel is like a little island you can rip from the ocean at will. Very much like an island, when you leave the channel, it disappears as if it never existed. Sound neat?

So yea there ain't much else to explain. Have fun, enjoy this new feature and don't forget to tell J any shovel related puns you can think of

Best,
SomeGuy
